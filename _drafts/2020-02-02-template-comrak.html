  <p>The full problem statement can be found on the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1">Advent of Code
      2019</a>
    page. I recommend reading the description on their page as the context of
    the problem is quite fun. However, you can find the relevant portions
    below.</p>
  <p><em>NOTE: All the code in this post, including this write-up itself, can be
      found or generated from the <a href="https://github.com/zakaluka/DailyCodingProblems">GitHub repository</a>.</em>

  <h2><a href="#problem-1a" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="_problem-1a"></a>Problem 1a</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>At the first Go / No Go poll, every Elf is Go until the Fuel
      Counter-Upper. They haven't determined the amount of fuel required yet.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Fuel required to launch a given module is based on its mass. Specifically,
      to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three,
      round down, and subtract 2.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2><a href="#problem-1b" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="_problem-1b"></a>Problem 1b</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>During the second Go / No Go poll, the Elf in charge of the Rocket
      Equation Double-Checker stops the launch sequence. Apparently, you forgot to
      include additional fuel for the fuel you just added.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, divide by
      three, round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel also requires fuel,
      and that fuel requires fuel, and so on. Any mass that would require negative
      fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel; the remaining
      mass, if any, is instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass
      and is outside the scope of this calculation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>So, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total.
      Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat
      the process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative.</p>

  <h1><a href="#solution" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="_solution"></a>Solution</h1>
  <p>The solutions to both problems are quite simple. The full source code is
    available at the <a href="https://github.com/zakaluka/DailyCodingProblems">above link</a>.</p>
  <p>However, I will highlight a realization I had - and repeatedly have, so
    maybe I need to do a better job of learning my lesson the first time!</p>
  <p>First, here is the source code from my solution to Problem 1a.</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-rust">pub fn calculate_fuel(mass: u64) -&gt; u64 {
  let denominator = 3u64;
  let subtract_from = 2u64;

  (mass.div_euclid(denominator)) - subtract_from
}
</code></pre>
  <p>While this code is simple, it contains an insidious bug. It has to do with
    an invariant of <code>u64</code>, specifically around subtraction.</p>
  <p>The problem is that when a subtraction occurs with two <code>u64</code> values, it can
    result in an overflow if the second number is larger than the first (e.g.
    <code>1u64 - 2u64</code>). This causes a panic.</p>
  <p>Now, when I was testing Problem 1a, I only used the samples provided in the
    problem statement. None of the samples exhibited this behavior, so I
    thought the solution was correct. Based on this belief, I wrote the
    solution to Problem 1b using the logic from Problem 1a. Hoever, as you can
    see from the problem statement for Problem 1b, it is guaranteed to trigger
    the panic because we continually look for smaller fuel values until we don't
    need any more fuel.</p>
  <h2><a href="#avoiding-the-problem" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="_avoiding-the-problem"></a>Avoiding the
    problem</h2>
  <p>There is a very easy way I could have avoided this problem - by using
    property-based testing. I have used the <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/proptest">proptest crate</a> in the past,
    and it has been very helpful in finding exactly these kinds of
    bugs - by ensuring that type-level invariants are not violated. However, in
    this case, I foolishly thought that this wasn't needed for the first Advent
    of Code problem.</p>
  <p>When I hit the issue with Problem 1b, I re-wrote the same algorithm as
    follows:</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-rust">pub fn calculate_fuel(mass: u64) -&gt; u64 {
  // Safe helper to calculate fuel needed for a single mass while avoiding a
  // panic with `u64` subtraction.
  fn calculate_single_fuel(mass: u64) -&gt; u64 {
    let denominator = 3u64;
    let subtract_from = 2u64;

    // Ensure that there is no overflow for `u64`.
    let div_result: u64 = mass.div_euclid(denominator);
    if div_result &lt; subtract_from {
      0
    } else {
      div_result - subtract_from
    }
  }

  // Tail-recursive helper to calculate total fuel needed.
  fn cf_helper(acc: u64, mass: u64) -&gt; u64 {
    if mass == 0 {
      acc
    } else {
      let fuel = calculate_single_fuel(mass);
      cf_helper(acc + fuel, fuel)
    }
  }

  cf_helper(0, mass)
}
</code></pre>
  <p>The <code>cf_helper</code> function is unique to Problem 1b. However,
    <code>calculate_single_fuel</code> is the new version of the previous <code>calculate_fuel</code>.
    Even though the function is small, it is twice the size of the original with
    a new conditional check.</p>
  <p>This check prevents the aforementioned issue with the code. After I found
    this problem, I added property-based testing to the codebase. I already
    knew about the issue with the solution to Problem 1a, so I limited
    property-based testing to Problem 1b.</p>
  <p>As you can imagine, <code>proptest</code> immediately identified the obvious mirror to
    the problem, i.e. calculating a required fuel that is so large that it
    overflows the maximum value of <code>u64</code>. This issue was found when performing
    property-based testing on <code>calculate_fuels</code>, whose source code is below.</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-rust">pub fn calculate_fuels(mass: Vec&lt;u64&gt;) -&gt; u64 {
  mass
    .iter()
    .map(|e| calculate_fuel(*e))
    .fold(0, |acc, e| acc + e)
}
</code></pre>
  <p>And quite helpfully, <code>proptest</code> identified a minimal test case to cause the
    overflow.</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-rust">t = [
  10706112062174250612,
  10670116926240500292,
  8727707064076103253,
  6789552094928250156,
]
</code></pre>
  <p>However, I did not fix this problem programmatically and for good reason (I
    believe). First, dealing with this problem will potentially add significant
    complexity to the solution. Based on my understanding of the
    problem statement, this is not a realistic occurrence. Thus, I added an
    assumption to the function and, if that assumption is violated, then the
    program will panic.</p>
  <p>What does this mean from a &quot;real-world&quot; perspective? If this was a function
    in a real-world solution, then the first question to ask the domain experts
    would be whether they consider this situation to be an issue. If it is
    identified as a domain-level problem with some expected behavior, then it
    must be addressed explicitly in the code (e.g. creating an internal type
    with its own invariants, returning a <code>Result</code>, etc.). However, if it is not,
    then a panic is a valid response and if the panic occurs when someone is
    using the library, the situation should be discussed with those same experts
    to understand how it should be handled. This <a
      href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/against-railway-oriented-programming/">article</a> from Scott
    Wlaschin makes a good case against protecting against such errors when there
    is a need to &quot;fail fast&quot; so that problems can be quickly identified and
    addressed up front. There is no obvious way for the program to continue and
    for Santa to get back to Earth if fuel cannot be calculated. As such,
    failing is the best option so that assumptions and designs can be
    re-reviewed and re-discussed thoroughly.</p>
  <p>In this instance, I have left the code as-is and have not addressed the
    issue with Problem 1b's <code>calculate_fuels</code> method.</p>
  <h1><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="_conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>I seem to always be re-learning a lesson when it comes to property-based
    testing. And that lesson is - just do it. At worst, it will validate parts
    of the design. But more often than not, it will highlight issues ranging
    from logic errors to implicit assumptions. And that can only help the code
    improve and be of higher quality when it is delivered.</p>
  <p>As for the &quot;bug&quot; that has been left in the program, I do believe that
    attempting to handle this problem programmatically with incomplete
    information would be a case of incorrect over-engineering. Maybe if this
    library were exposed as a web service with wide-ranging use cases that
    cannot be anticipated during initial development, the response might be
    slightly different. However, in the end, libraries should deal with
    expected situations gracefully. Unexpected situations that result in errors
    should fail fast so that problems can be recognized and the defect can be
    reported and handled appropriately. Please note that I'm not referring to
    how end users of a program (i.e. non-technical folks) are presented with
    this issue. I am referring to other developers who are making use of a
    library.</p>
  <p>See you in the next one!</p>
