          Linked List</a></h1>
      <p>The problem statement is as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead
          of each node holding <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> fields, it holds a field named
          <code>both</code>, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement
          an XOR linked list; it has an <code>add(element)</code> which adds the element to the
          end, and a <code>get(index)</code> which returns the node at index.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python) you can assume
          you have access to <code>get_pointer</code> and <code>dereference_pointer</code> functions that
          converts between nodes and memory addresses.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h1 id="preface-to-solution" class="section-header"><a href="#preface-to-solution">Preface to Solution</a></h1>
      <p>This problem represents a large gap in my recent blog posts because, when I
        encountered this problem, I saw it as an opportunity to learn <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>
      <p>For those who are not familiar, here is a short description from
        <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/rust/">Mozilla Research</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Rust is an open-source systems programming language that focuses on speed,
          memory safety and parallelism. Developers are using Rust to create a wide
          range of new software applications, such as game engines, operating
          systems, file systems, browser components and simulation engines for
          virtual reality.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Rust is a &quot;low-level&quot; language whose syntax is quite close to C/C++.
        However, it also provides a number of higher-level concepts from other
        object-oriented and functional programming languages.</p>
      <p>In particular, Rust has a very strong concept of memory safety through
        concepts of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">ownership</a> and <a
          href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html">borrowing</a>. While there are
        lots of other
        articles about this feature and its implementation, here is how it finally
        made sense to me: Rust's memory safety is somewhat similar to a pessimistic
        database lock. Because mutability is very explicit in Rust, there can be as
        many <code>readers</code> as desired for a single location in memory. However, when
        a <code>writer</code> wants to mutate that memory, it receives and keeps exclusive
        access to that memory until the work is complete.</p>
      <p>As you can imagine, doubly linked lists are particularly annoying in Rust
        because a common question that comes up is 'Who owns the current node, the
        previous or the next node'. There is an excellent <a
          href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/">article</a> about linked
        lists in Rust for those wanting a correct and much better introduction to
        linked lists in Rust.</p>
      <p>It took me the better part of the last few months to learn enough about Rust
        to get this exercise working. I gave up pretty much once a month, wrote this
        solution partially in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and in <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>, and did
        a lot of
        experimentation to get to this point. In the end, I was not able to make my
        code completely 'safe' in Rust, but I am not sure that is possible with an
        XOR linked list. In any case, all feedback is welcome and greatly
        appreciated.</p>
      <h1 id="solution" class="section-header"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h1>
      <h2 id="data-model" class="section-header"><a href="#data-model">Data model</a></h2>
      <p>The key to this problem, in my mind, is to design the correct data structure
        that can work with an XOR linked list while also ensuring that objects are
        not prematurely destroyed (a problem in Rust since the language calls the
        <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/destructors.html">destructor</a> as soon as the last reference to an
        object goes out of
        scope).</p>
      <p>Going with the classic model, a linked list is made of a series of nodes.
        My choice was to create two data structures that, together, represent an XOR
        linked list:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>An <code>XORLinkedListNode</code> is a <a
            href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html">struct</a> (similar to a F# record, a
          Java
          class without methods, or a data transfer object) that holds the following
          information:
          <ol>
            <li><code>element</code> holds an integer, representing the value of the node.</li>
            <li><code>both</code> holds the XOR'ed memory address.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>An <code>XORLinkedList</code> is a struct that holds the following information:
          <ol>
            <li><code>nodes</code> keeps a reference to all <code>XORLinkedListNode</code> objects so
              that Rust does not <code>drop</code> while they are still part of the list.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition to the above, there are two additional considerations to keep in
        mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Rust compiler is free to move objects around in memory for efficiency
          purposes, whether on the stack or the heap. Because of the strong memory
          safety that Rust provides, this is considered a relatively safe action.
          However, if the compiler chooses to move items around, that would
          invalidate the <code>both</code> pointer. To prevent this, each node has a 3rd
          element in its struct called <code>_pin</code>.
          <ul>
            <li><code>_pin</code> forces Rust to pin an object to a memory address. More
              information can be found <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/pin/index.html">here</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>By default, Rust creates objects on the stack. To create objects on the
          heap so that they outlive the execution of a function, Rust provides
          <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html">boxed</a> values.
          <ul>
            <li>The types of <code>nodes</code> in the <code>XORLinkedList</code> is
              <code>Vec&lt;Pin&lt;Box&lt;XORLinkedListNode&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, i.e. a vector of boxed, pinned
              <code>XORLinkedListNode</code> values.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="xorlinkedlistnode" class="section-header"><a href="#xorlinkedlistnode">XORLinkedListNode</a></h2>
      <p><code>XORLinkedListNode</code> provides two methods. THe first is the equivalent of a
        simple constructor that creates new nodes. The second is a <code>set_both</code>
        function that changes the value of <code>both</code> for a boxed, pinned node.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-text">unsafe fn set_both(new_both: usize, node: &amp;mut Pin&lt;Box&lt;XORLinkedListNode&gt;&gt;)
{
  let x = node.as_mut();
  Pin::get_unchecked_mut(x).both = new_both;
}
</code></pre>
      <h2 id="xorlinkedlist" class="section-header"><a href="#xorlinkedlist">XORLinkedList</a></h2>
      <p><code>XORLinkedList</code> provides the two methods requested in the original problem
        statement, <code>add</code> and <code>get</code>.</p>
      <p><code>add</code> is responsible for two key actions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Creating the new node.</li>
        <li>Fixing the <code>both</code> attribute of the last node in a non-empty linked list.</li>
      </ol>
      <pre><code class="language-text">// Adds an item to the end of the linked list.
fn add(&amp;mut self, v: i32) -&gt; &amp;XORLinkedList {
  // Linked list is empty, so add the value with an `EMPTY` both
  // pointer.
  if self.nodes.is_empty() {
    // First, create the new node.
    let n = XORLinkedListNode::new(v, None);

    // Add node to the internal vector.
    self.nodes.push(n);

    self
  } else {
    // Convenience variable for current length.
    let l = self.nodes.len();

    // Create new tail node with `both` set to the address of the old tail.
    // Then, adds the new tail to the internal vector.
    self.nodes.push(XORLinkedListNode::new(
      v,
      Option::from(self.nodes[l - 1].deref()),
    ));

    // Fixes the old tail's `both` to point to the address of the new tail.
    unsafe {
      XORLinkedListNode::set_both(
        self.nodes[l - 1].both ^ address(self.nodes[l].deref()),
        &amp;mut self.nodes[l - 1],
      );
    }

    self
  }
}
</code></pre>
      <p><code>get</code> uses a recursive helper function to walk the list and retrieve the
        desired index. In its current implementation, <code>get</code> will <code>panic</code> if the
        requested index is outside the length of the linked list.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-text">// Returns the `XORLinkedListNode` at the given index. This will panic if
// the index is outside the length of the linked list.
fn get(&amp;self, index: usize) -&gt; &amp;XORLinkedListNode {
  // (Tail-)Recursive function that returns the node at the given index. `n`
  // represents the current node under investigation. `idx` represents the
  // index being counted down (0-based). `prev_address` represents the
  // memory address of the previous node, so that it can be XORed with
  // `n.both` to get the next node's address.
  fn get_helper(
    n: &amp;XORLinkedListNode,
    idx: usize,
    prev_address: usize,
  ) -&gt; &amp;XORLinkedListNode {
    if idx == 0 {
      n
    } else {
      // Get the address of the next node.
      let next_address = n.both ^ prev_address;
      let next_n = next_address as *const XORLinkedListNode;
      get_helper(unsafe { &amp;(*next_n) }, idx - 1, address(n))
    }
  }

  // Call `get_helper`. The previous node of the first entry in the list is
  // always `EMPTY`.
  get_helper(&amp;self.nodes[0], index, EMPTY)
}
</code></pre>
      <h2 id="utility-methods" class="section-header"><a href="#utility-methods">Utility methods</a></h2>
      <p>The code uses one utility constant and one utility function to make coding
        easier.</p>
      <p>The first is a constant called <code>EMPTY</code> which represents the so-called empty
        address, i.e. <code>0x0</code>.</p>
      <p>The second is a function that returns the address of an object.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-text">// Gets the memory address of an object.
fn address&lt;T&gt;(elt: &amp;T) -&gt; usize {
  usize::from_str_radix(format!(&quot;{:p}&quot;, elt).trim_start_matches(&quot;0x&quot;), 16)
    .unwrap()
}
</code></pre>
      <h1 id="testing" class="section-header"><a href="#testing">Testing</a></h1>
      <p>Testing in Rust was extremely easy, thanks to built-in support using the
        <code>cargo test</code> command.</p>
      <p>For this exercise, I did not perform any property-based testing. By the end,
        I just wanted to get my code working. However, this exercise really
        highlighted the value of unit testing. It was through testing that I
        realized that Rust is free to move objects around in memory, even if they
        were allocated on the heap. I don't know if other languages also have this
        behavior, but it was very surprising to me. That is what led me down the
        rabbit hole of both pinned and boxed values.</p>
      <h1 id="conclusion" class="section-header"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h1>
      <p>Even though this was my first coding challenge in Rust, I don't think I
        could have picked a better problem to help me learn about some key concepts
        in Rust:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Heap allocations</li>
        <li>Memory safety</li>
        <li>Unsafe functions</li>
        <li>Immutability vs. mutability</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I am planning to write the next few solutions in Rust to build up my
        knowledge of the language.</p>
      <p>See you in the next one!</p>
