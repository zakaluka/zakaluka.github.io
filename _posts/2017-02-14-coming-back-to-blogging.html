<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Hi All,<br /><br />It's been a long, LONG time, but I believe I am finally ready to come back to blogging. &nbsp;It helps that I've finally found a good placed in life (in every way) and am starting to love development again.<br /><br />I'll be restarting my blogging exercise by walking through my solutions for the <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> challenge for 2016. &nbsp;I've already got the solutions, in F# of course, for the first 5 days - i.e. 10 problems. &nbsp;I'll post about those first, then continue with the remaining ones.<br /><br />This promises to be quite an adventure - at least for me personally. &nbsp;And I'm looking forward to sharing it with all of you (and learning from all of you as well).<br /><br />Kind regards.</div>
