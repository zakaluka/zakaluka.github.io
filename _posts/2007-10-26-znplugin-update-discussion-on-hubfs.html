I've initiated two discussions at hubFS (<a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/3806.aspx">Post 3806</a> and <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/3786.aspx">Post 3786</a>) on some aspects on znPlugin. Specifically, the parts that relate to performing efficient type comparisons and casting. There are a lot of ideas in that thread, including some sample code. Post #3875 is particularly significant, as it is responsible for the latest changes in the framework.<br /><br />The discussions have slowed somewhat, but they are still good reads for people interested in Reflection within F#.
