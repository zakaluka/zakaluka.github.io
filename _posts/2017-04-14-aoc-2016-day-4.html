<h1 id="aoc-2016---day-4">AOC 2016 - Day 4</h1>
<p><em><a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/4">Problem statement</a> on Advent of Code website.</em></p>
<p><em>Code for this post can be found on <a href="https://github.com/zakaluka/fsaoc2016/tree/master/4">GitHub</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>On Day 1, we located Easter Bunny headquarters.</li>
<li>On Day 2, we broke the code to use the bathroom in Easter Bunny HQ.</li>
<li>On Day 3, we helped the EBs' design department by removing invalid triangles from the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Day 4, we will figure out which rooms on an encrypted information kiosk are valid and which ones are not.</p>
<h2 id="problem---part-1">Problem - Part 1</h2>
<p>The kiosk lists one room per line. Each room entry consists of 3 parts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Encrypted name comprised of lowercase letters separated by dashes
<ul>
<li>Always follows by a dash</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sector ID</li>
<li>Checksum
<ul>
<li>Always in square brackets</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>For Part 1, we have to determine which entries are real by calculating a checksum based on the encrypted name. The actual answer we have to provide is the sum of the sector IDs for all valid rooms.</p>
<p>Before I dive into the solution, I want to note that this problem has a lot of moving parts and, even though I've already solved it, it took me over half an hour to understand it again. There's just something about it that confuses the heck out of me every time.</p>
<h2 id="solution---part-1">Solution - Part 1</h2>
<p>I approached the solution from a few different angles before I settled on the following solution.</p>
<p>I started by first trying to understand the overall steps involved in the solution. Then, once I had a basic picture worked out, I focused on creating a data structure that could hold all the data that I needed.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted a single 'flow' to the logic and to do that, I would have to pull together separate pieces of data and then start tying them together. With the right data structure, I could basically thread it through all my functions and tie them together nicely at the end.</p>
<p>My overall solution strategy is as follows.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Store each unchanged line of data.</li>
<li>Extract the sector ID and checksum.
<ul>
<li>Based on the requested answer, we can assume that all sector IDs are numeric values.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Calculate the checksums for each encrypted room name.</li>
<li>Finally, filter the list and add up the valid rooms' sector IDs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The one thing that I noticed above all else is that I had to go out and learn a lot more about regular expressions in general and .NET regular expressions specifically to solve this problem.</p>
<h3 id="create-the-data-structure">Create the data structure</h3>
<p>My whole solution hinges on a data structure that can hold all the data I need a series of disparate functions that only come together at the end.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">type</span> Line = {
line: <span class="dt">string</span>
sectorID: <span class="dt">int</span>
calculatedChecksum: <span class="dt">string</span>
providedChecksum: <span class="dt">string</span>
}

<span class="kw">let</span> emptyLine = {
line = <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>; sectorID = <span class="dv">0</span>; calculatedChecksum = <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>; providedChecksum = <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>;
decryptedText = <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can tell, I chose to go with a record for this solution. <code>emptyLine</code> is simply an empty <code>Line</code> for convenience in various functions.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>line</code></dt>
<dd>Holds the unaltered line from the input file.
</dd>
<dt><code>sectorID</code></dt>
<dd>The provided sector ID extracted from the raw line.
</dd>
<dt><code>calculatedChecksum</code></dt>
<dd>The calculated checksum based on the encrypted room name.
</dd>
<dt><code>providedChecksum</code></dt>
<dd>The provided checksum extracted from the raw line.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="store-each-unchanged-line-of-data">Store each unchanged line of data</h3>
<p>I chose to make this its own step because of the <a href="https://znprojects.blogspot.com/2017/04/aoc-2016-day-3.html#lessons-learned">lesson I learned</a> from my last solution, where the parsing strategy was different between Parts 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The code to extract each line from the input file is quite simple.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> lines filename =
File<span class="kw">.</span>ReadAllLines filename
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>cast
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>map (<span class="kw">fun</span> x -&gt; {emptyLine <span class="kw">with</span> line = <span class="dt">string</span> x})</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="extract-the-provided-sector-id-and-checksum">Extract the provided sector ID and checksum</h3>
<p>Extracting the sector ID proved to be quite an issue until I read the problem over a few more times. Once I understood that the sector ID is numeric only (since we have to add them up) and the encrypted name (and thus the checksum) is composed of lower-case letters only, the regular expression was relatively simple.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> extractSectorIDs lines =
lines
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>map
  (<span class="kw">fun</span> l -&gt;
  {l <span class="kw">with</span>
    sectorID = (Regex<span class="kw">.</span>Match (l.line, @<span class="st">&quot;[0-9]+&quot;</span>)).Groups<span class="kw">.</span>[<span class="dv">0</span>].Value |&gt; <span class="dt">int</span>})</code></pre></div>
<p>Extracting the checksum was easier because the problem states that the checksum is enclosed by square brackets <code>[]</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> extractProvidedChecksums lines =
lines
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>map
  (<span class="kw">fun</span> l -&gt;
    {l <span class="kw">with</span>
      providedChecksum =
      (Regex<span class="kw">.</span>Match (l.line, @<span class="st">&quot;\[([a-zA-Z]+)\]&quot;</span>)).Groups<span class="kw">.</span>[<span class="dv">1</span>].Value})</code></pre></div>
<p>The hardest thing was knowing which <code>Group</code> I wanted from each regular expression. This required a decent amount of trial and error in online .NET regex tools and F# interactive.</p>
<h3 id="calculate-the-checksum">Calculate the checksum</h3>
<p>I started by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Extracting the encrypted room name from each <code>line</code></li>
<li>Removing the dashes</li>
<li>Concatenating all parts of the encrypted name (if more than 1)</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> calculateChecksums lines =
lines
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>map
  (<span class="kw">fun</span> l -&gt;
    {l <span class="kw">with</span>
      calculatedChecksum =
      (Regex<span class="kw">.</span>Matches (l.line, @<span class="st">&quot;([a-zA-Z]+)\-&quot;</span>))
      |&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>cast
      |&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>map
        (<span class="kw">fun</span> (x : System<span class="kw">.</span>Text<span class="kw">.</span>RegularExpressions<span class="kw">.</span>Match) -&gt;
          <span class="kw">let</span> substr = x.Value
          substr.Substring(<span class="dv">0</span>, String<span class="kw">.</span>length substr - <span class="dv">1</span>))
      |&gt; String<span class="kw">.</span>concat <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>
      |&gt; calculateChecksum
    }
  )</code></pre></div>
<p>Once the encrypted name was cleaned up and transformed, I passed it over to a separate function to calculate the checksum.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> calculateChecksum (line: <span class="dt">string</span>) =
line
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>countBy id
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>sortBy fst
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>sortByDescending snd
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>truncate <span class="dv">5</span>
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>fold (<span class="kw">fun</span> accum (elt, _) -&gt; accum + elt.ToString()) <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function relies heavily on the assertion in the .NET documentation that <code>Seq.sort</code> and its variants are stable sorts.</p>
<h3 id="tie-it-all-together">Tie it all together</h3>
<p>The last step is to tie all the steps together by threading a <code>seq&lt;Line&gt;</code> through the logic.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> day4part1 =
lines puzzleInput
|&gt; extractSectorIDs
|&gt; extractProvidedChecksums
|&gt; calculateChecksums
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>filter (<span class="kw">fun</span> x -&gt; x.providedChecksum = x.calculatedChecksum)
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>fold (<span class="kw">fun</span> accum elt -&gt; accum + elt.sectorID) <span class="dv">0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All the heavy lifting has already been done by the time we get to <code>Seq.filter</code>. I chose to go with <code>Seq.fold</code> instead of <code>Seq.reduce</code> because the latter can fail with an <code>ArgumentException</code> when the sequence is empty.</p>
<p>When you run this function on the input file, you get <code>158835</code>, which is, in fact, the correct answer.</p>
<h2 id="problem---part-2">Problem - Part 2</h2>
<p>For Part 2, we have to decrypt the encrypted room name using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">shift cipher</a>.</p>
<p>The question we have to answer is &quot;what is the sector ID of the room where North Pole objects are stored?&quot;</p>
<h2 id="solution---part-2">Solution - Part 2</h2>
<p>The changes were minimal for Part 2.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add a field to the <code>Line</code> record to hold the decrypted text.</li>
<li>Write a shift cipher.</li>
<li>Tie it all together.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="modify-the-data-structure">Modify the data structure</h3>
<p>I added the last field to the record - <code>decryptedText</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">type</span> Line = {
line: <span class="dt">string</span>
sectorID: <span class="dt">int</span>
calculatedChecksum: <span class="dt">string</span>
providedChecksum: <span class="dt">string</span>
decryptedText: <span class="dt">string</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<dl>
<dt><code>decryptedText</code></dt>
<dd>The decrypted room name. Needed to understand where the North Pole objects are being stored.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="write-the-shift-cipher-algorithm">Write the shift cipher algorithm</h3>
<p>A shift cipher, or Caesar cipher, is a relatively simple substitution cipher. Julius Caesar is widely credited as being its inventor. The key to the Caesar cipher is knowing two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The space through which we have to shift (e.g. only lowercase letters, upper and lowercase letters, the entire ASCII table, etc.)</li>
<li>The number of places to shift within the space.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I made some assumptions to guide the development of this algorithm.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I restricted the space to lowercase letters only. The single example provided by the problem bears out this assumption.</li>
<li>The shift count is the sector ID.</li>
<li>The algorithm should not shift dashes, but just convert them directly to spaces.</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> shiftCipher (letter: <span class="dt">char</span>) shift =
<span class="kw">let</span> asciiStart = <span class="dv">97</span>
<span class="kw">let</span> numChars = <span class="dv">26</span>
<span class="kw">let</span> charToInt x = (<span class="dt">int</span> x) - asciiStart
<span class="kw">let</span> intToChar x = <span class="dt">char</span> (x + asciiStart)
<span class="kw">if</span> letter = <span class="ch">&#39;-&#39;</span> <span class="kw">then</span> <span class="ch">&#39; &#39;</span>
<span class="kw">else</span> letter |&gt; charToInt |&gt; (+) shift |&gt; (<span class="kw">fun</span> x -&gt; x % numChars) |&gt; intToChar</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="tie-it-all-together-1">Tie it all together</h3>
<p>The function that tied together the solution for Part 2 went through a few iterations and makes at least one large assumption.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The initial part of the algorithm is similar to Part 1, since our starting point is the list of valid rooms.</li>
<li>Then, I calculated the decrypted name for each room.</li>
<li>Finally, I settled on a big assumption that the room storing the &quot;North Pole objects&quot; would start with the word &quot;north&quot;.
<ul>
<li>This assumption turned out to be correct, obviously.</li>
<li>I also tried other variations, such as 'north' in the text, 'North' in the text, 'North Pole' in the text, etc.</li>
<li>This actually affected my shift cipher algorithm, since capital letters change the shift space.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> day4part2 =
lines puzzleInput
|&gt; extractSectorIDs
|&gt; extractProvidedChecksums
|&gt; calculateChecksums
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>filter (<span class="kw">fun</span> x -&gt; x.calculatedChecksum = x.providedChecksum)
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>map
  (<span class="kw">fun</span> l -&gt;
  {l <span class="kw">with</span>
    decryptedText =
    (Regex<span class="kw">.</span>Match (l.line, @<span class="st">&quot;([a-zA-Z]+\-)+&quot;</span>)).Groups<span class="kw">.</span>[<span class="dv">0</span>].Value
    |&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>map (<span class="kw">fun</span> elt -&gt; shiftCipher elt l.sectorID)
    |&gt; System<span class="kw">.</span>String<span class="kw">.</span>Concat
  })
|&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>filter (<span class="kw">fun</span> l -&gt; l.decryptedText.StartsWith(<span class="st">&quot;north&quot;</span>))</code></pre></div>
<p>When you calculate <code>day4part2</code>, you get sector ID <code>993</code>, which is the correct answer.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>This is the first AOC problem where I introduced testing, something that was long overdue. I did not use any framework, but created a <a href="https://github.com/zakaluka/fsaoc2016/blob/master/4/FourTest.fsx">separate script file</a> that contained basic unit tests. These tests printed their results to the console and were quite crude (I calculated the results manually and then turned those results into unit tests).</p>
<p>Despite how simple the tests were, they cut down the trial and error time considerably. I especially felt the impact on this problem where I kept hitting roadblocks every step of the way.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>I learned a few lessons from this exercise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Creating separate functions for different pieces of the solution was a good idea and allowed for a lot of reusability.
<ul>
<li>I will definitely be continuing this trend in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The semi-automated testing, as crude as it was, helped immensely.
<ul>
<li>This is even easier for AOC since we have specific examples given with each Part of each problem.</li>
<li>I definitely need to put even more effort into testing in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>See you next time!</p>
