Thus, the code will often look awkward and weird. If I were to re-code the solution, knowing what I know now, I would definitely make some changes.</p><p>Please note that I have NOT gone back and &quot;fixed up&quot; the code. This is the actual code I wrote to successfully solve each challenge. Are there things I would change - Yes. However, I am much more interested in finding solutions for new problems than I am in fixing this code, especially since no one else is relying on it.</p><p>I have tried to learn from my mistakes, as will hopefully be obvious from code written for future challenges.</p><h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2><p>The following theme is used, at least as far as I know, to tie all 25 days worth of AOC problems together.</p><blockquote><p>Santa's sleigh uses a very high-precision clock to guide its movements, and the clock's oscillator is regulated by stars. Unfortunately, the stars have been stolen... by the Easter Bunny. To save Christmas, Santa needs you to retrieve all fifty stars by December 25th.</p></blockquote><p>The second paragraph actually tells you that there are 2 problems each day. Obviously, I was not paying attention to detail like I should have (emphasis is mine).</p><blockquote><p>Collect stars by solving puzzles. <em>Two puzzles will be made available on each day</em> in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!</p></blockquote><p>The reason I mention this is that the code may look awkward for certain solutions when I am trying to re-use code from that day's first part.</p><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2><p>Rather than copy-paste lots of text, I will briefly describe the problem. Please go to the <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1">AOC</a> website to see the original information.</p><p>The first problem is a relatively simple example of writing an algorithm to move in a grid-like pattern with no diagonal movements (since you can only turn left and right by 90°) - this is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Taxicab geometry</a>.</p><h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2><h3 id="types">Types</h3><p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> <em>Although I am solving all these problems in F#, what really got me back into programming (and loving it again!) is the language <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. If you don't know what Elm is, I highly recommend taking a look. It is a beginner-friendly functional language designed to write safe web applications (it is compiled into Javascript). One of the tips to solve problems in Elm (or pretty much any language for that matter), is to start by defining your types. That is what I did here.</em></p><p>After a few false starts, here is how I chose to <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/e72f1f6365880cbad3eab4b729be00eb#file-blog-aocd1p1-types2-fs">define the types</a>. Initially, I did not have the <code>Point</code> type but this was added later on to facilitate work on Day 1, Part 2.</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">type</span> Direction =<br />  | North<br />  | South<br />  | East<br />  | West<br /><br /><span class="kw">type</span> TurnTo =<br />  | R<br />  | L<br /><br /><span class="kw">type</span> Point = {<br />  x : <span class="dt">int</span><br />  y : <span class="dt">int</span><br />}<br /><br /><span class="kw">type</span> Location = {<br />  dir : Direction<br />  pt : Point<br />}</code></pre></div><p>In order to make life easier, I have a few <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/9b49dc9155c1880ea9458fe9b11826df#file-blog-aocd1p1-basevalues2-fs">base values</a> for my complex types.</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> startPt = {<br />  x = <span class="dv">0</span><br />  y = <span class="dv">0</span><br />}<br /><br /><span class="kw">let</span> startLoc = {<br />  dir = North<br />  pt = startPt<br />}</code></pre></div><h3 id="reading-the-instructions">Reading the instructions</h3><p>Now that I have defined my types, I can start diving into the logic. The first task I need to solve is to convert instructions (which was not as easy as I thought - more on that further down in the post) into my nice types. I built a <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/1027b294086f6a441e739db6ee29322e#file-blog-aocd1p1-parsefile2-fs">small helper function</a> to translate a character representing the direction (L and R) into a <code>TurnTo</code> value.</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> toTurn = <span class="kw">function</span><br />  | <span class="ch">&#39;R&#39;</span> -&gt; R<br />  | <span class="ch">&#39;L&#39;</span> -&gt; L<br />  | _ -&gt; failwith <span class="st">&quot;Unknown turn type&quot;</span></code></pre></div><h3 id="individual-moves">Individual moves</h3><p>For each individual instruction in the list, I need to do 2 things:</p><ol type="1"><li>turn in the appropriate direction</li><li>move forward the specified number of blocks.</li></ol><p>In the spirit of writing small, digestible functions and stringing them together, I broke this logic into two steps. First, since my current location includes my cardinal direction, I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/f62081b26f5d9d6f415cc247460d22d9#file-blog-aocd1p1-turn2-fs">a small function</a> to implement the <code>turn</code>. The signature of this function is <code>TurnTo -&gt; Location -&gt; Location</code>. It takes a <code>Direction</code> to turn in and the current <code>Location</code> (which includes my current <code>Direction</code>), and returns a new <code>Location</code> record where I am pointing in the updated direction based on the instruction.</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> turn way loc =<br />  <span class="kw">match</span> way <span class="kw">with</span><br />  | L -&gt;<br />    <span class="kw">match</span> loc.dir <span class="kw">with</span><br />    | North -&gt; { loc <span class="kw">with</span> dir = West }<br />    | West -&gt; { loc <span class="kw">with</span> dir = South }<br />    | South -&gt; { loc <span class="kw">with</span> dir = East }<br />    | East -&gt; { loc <span class="kw">with</span> dir = North }<br />  | R -&gt;<br />    <span class="kw">match</span> loc.dir <span class="kw">with</span><br />    | North -&gt; { loc <span class="kw">with</span> dir = East }<br />    | East -&gt; { loc <span class="kw">with</span> dir = South }<br />    | South -&gt; { loc <span class="kw">with</span> dir = West }<br />    | West -&gt; { loc <span class="kw">with</span> dir = North }</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/373ae5faffd058077246ec48091fb38c#file-blog-aocd1p1-advance2-fs">The second function</a> I wrote <code>advance</code>s me in the given direction. This function's signature is <code>int -&gt; Location -&gt; Location</code>. Similar to <code>turn</code>, this function takes the number of blocks to move and current <code>Location</code>, and returns a new, post-move <code>Location</code>.</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> advance dist loc =<br />  <span class="kw">match</span> loc.dir <span class="kw">with</span><br />  | North -&gt;<br />    <span class="kw">let</span> npt = { x = loc.pt.x; y = loc.pt.y + dist }<br />    { loc <span class="kw">with</span> pt = npt }<br />  | South -&gt;<br />    <span class="kw">let</span> npt = { x = loc.pt.x; y = loc.pt.y - dist }<br />    { loc <span class="kw">with</span> pt = npt }<br />  | West -&gt;<br />    <span class="kw">let</span> npt = { x = loc.pt.x - dist; y = loc.pt.y }<br />    { loc <span class="kw">with</span> pt = npt }<br />  | East -&gt;<br />    <span class="kw">let</span> npt = { x = loc.pt.x + dist; y = loc.pt.y }<br />    { loc <span class="kw">with</span> pt = npt }</code></pre></div><p>And now we just need to <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/fbe05fb3a30a71d6ed00981d84e74ed5#file-blog-aocd1p1-move2-fs">tie them together</a> to <code>move</code>. Move is quite simple - it's purpose is to put together a turn and an advancement into a single action. Its signature is <code>TurnTo -&gt; int -&gt; (Location -&gt; Location)</code>. What this means is that it takes a <code>TurnTo</code> and an <code>int</code>, then returns a function. When a <code>Location</code> is passed to this new function, the character will perform a single move. Here, I am using the F# function composition operator.  You can find a good writeup on it <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/chrsmith/2008/06/14/function-composition/">here</a>.</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> move way dist = (turn way) &gt;&gt; (advance dist)</code></pre></div><h3 id="stringing-moves-together">Stringing moves together</h3><p>Most of the guts of this algorithm are now coded, but we are still missing 2 main pieces:</p><ol type="1"><li>the <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/3b2be94503074b911945c7c26cf2cd53#file-blog-aocd1p1-moveall2-fs">connection from a list of instructions to actual movements</a>, and</li><li>calculating the distance from the start point (assumed to be (0,0) facing North) to the final <code>Location</code>.</li></ol><p>This duty falls to the <code>moveAll</code> function. This function takes a <code>string</code> and returns a <code>Location</code>. It parses the list of instructions and then progressively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)">folds</a> the intermediate results into a final Location.</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> moveAll strList =<br />  Regex<span class="kw">.</span>Matches (strList, @<span class="st">&quot;[LR]\d+&quot;</span>)<br />  |&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>cast<br />  |&gt; Seq<span class="kw">.</span>fold<br />    (<span class="kw">fun</span> oldloc (instr : System<span class="kw">.</span>Text<span class="kw">.</span>RegularExpressions<span class="kw">.</span>Match) -&gt;<br />      move<br />        (instr.Value<span class="kw">.</span>[<span class="dv">0</span>] |&gt; toTurn)<br />        (instr.Value<span class="kw">.</span>Substring <span class="dv">1</span> |&gt; <span class="dt">int</span>)<br />        oldloc<br />    )<br />    startLoc</code></pre></div><p>Now we come to the end and put a bow on the solution. The <code>distance</code> function just <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/564ab0c22e8e5c2735e2e0c824b1ad50#file-blog-aocd1p1-distance2-fs">calculates the distance</a> between the initial and final points using Taxicab geometry and <code>partOne : strList:string -&gt; int</code> ties <code>moveAll</code> to <code>distance</code>.</p><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode fsharp"><code class="sourceCode fsharp"><span class="kw">let</span> distance stloc endloc = (abs (stloc.x - endloc.x)) + (abs (stloc.y - endloc.y))<br /><br /><span class="kw">let</span> partOne strList =<br />  strList |&gt; moveAll |&gt; <span class="kw">fun</span> x -&gt; distance startPt x.pt</code></pre></div><h3 id="getting-the-answer-and-a-note-about-parsing-and-file-manipulation">Getting the answer, and a note about parsing and file manipulation</h3><p>I mentioned earlier that I would speak more about parsing. Well, the smart thing to do with a problem like this is to take the input from the AOC website, put it into a file, and then parse it in the code. However, when I started on AOC, I did not know how to perform file manipulation with F# (and apparently didn't want to learn for the first few days of problems). Thus, you will see odd things like <a href="https://gist.github.com/zakaluka/d1442c81e8e09b5152f48fb33f8f0b8e#file-blog-aocd1p1-partone2-fs">this block of code</a> in my solutions for the first few days. At some point, I realized that copy/pasting large blocks of text into an F# script file is not a smart idea and learned how to manipulate files (which turns out to be quite easy in .NET).</p><p>Putting all this together and seeing it run (at last!) was a great feeling. The answer you get if you run my code is <code>239</code>, which is, in fact, the correct answer.</p><p>I am intending to put all my code into <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> sometime in the near future. Until then, all my code for the first solution is actually on this page (and in my gists) except for one import of <code>System.Text.RegularExpressions</code>.</p><p>See you next time!</p>
